Let us stand together – and stand firm – against the many faces of hate.", "Yo, I'm going in.", "Social media websites are no longer performing an envisaged function of creating a positive communication link among friends, family and professionals. It is a veritable battleground, where insults fly from the human quiver, damaging lives, destroying self-esteem and a person's sense of self-worth.", "Bushido is realized in the presence of death. This means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death. There is no other reasoning." ];
